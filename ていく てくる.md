# ていく　てくる

## expresses the movement after that action.

**For Example:**

1. パーティーにワインを買って**行きます**。
    
    Literal translation: "I'm going to buy some wine **and go to the party.**"
    
    "I'll bring some wine to the party."
    
2. 今の音何？ちょっと見て**来ます**。
    
    Literal translation: "What's that sound? I'll **take a look and come back**."
    
    "What's that sound? I'll go and take a look."
    
3. *Asa-gohan o tabete **kimashita**.*朝ごはんを食べて**来ました**。
    
    Literal translation: "I had breakfast and came."
    
    "I've already had breakfast (before coming here)."
    

## expresses the direction of that movement based on the speaker's area/line of vision.

When a verb indicating movement precedes *iku* or *kuru*, *te iku* or *te kuru* expresses the direction of that movement.

| **"English"** | ***Te* *Form*** | ***Iku*/*Kuru*** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "to move" | *hikkoshite*(引越して) | *iku*(行く) | to move out (away from the area of the speaker) |
|  |  | *kuru*(来る) | to move in (into the area of the speaker) |
| "to enter" | *haitte*(入って) | *iku*(行く) | to enter (a place and draw away from the speaker) |
|  |  | *kuru*(来る) | to enter (the place where the speaker is) |
| "to escape," "to flee" | *nigete*(逃げて) | *iku*(行く) | to run away or to flee (and draw away from the speaker) |
|  |  | *kuru*(来る) | to flee (to the place where the speaker is) |

**Comparison**

Please compare the following sentences.

1. 犬が走って**行く**。
2. *Inu ga hashitte **kuru**.*犬が走って**来る**。

The first sentence expresses that the dog is running **away** from the speaker, whereas the second sentence expresses that the dog is running **toward** the speaker.

Let's look at more examples.

1. *Kanojo wa boku no heya kara dete **itta**.*彼女は僕の部屋から出て**行った**。
2. 彼女は僕の部屋から出て**来た**。

In the first sentence, **the speaker was still in his room**, so it means **the girl left the speaker** when she went out from the room.

In the second sentence, **the speaker was outside his room,** so this sentence means the girl came out of his room and into the speaker's area/line of vision.
