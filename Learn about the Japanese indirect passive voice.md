**Indirect Passive**

An indirect passive sentence normally implies that the subject is **inconvenienced by the action of the verb.** This grammar is called suffering passive, troubled passive, or *meiwaku no ukemi* 

**Formation**

**[Subject/Victim] は[Doer of the action] に[passive form of a verb]**

**Comparison**

1. 隣の人**は**タバコを**吸った**。"The person sitting next to me smoked."*.*

   →　(私は) 隣の人**に**タバコを**吸われた**。→ "The person sitting next to me smoked, and I was annoyed."
2. 雨**が降った**。"It rained."

   → 　(私は)雨**に降られた**。→ "It rained, and I was annoyed."

Please note that the doer of the action is usually animate and the action is volitional　(on purpose); however, there are a few exceptions, and *ame ni furareru* is one of them.

## **Passive vs. *-て　くれる*/*-て　もらう***

We learned that when the doer's action is **unwelcome or unfavorable**, we use the passive voice. Note that when the doer's action is ***welcome or favorable, we use -て　くれる or -て　もらう***. Please compare the following sentences.

**For Example:**

1. 僕はお母さんにジーンズを**洗われた**。"My mother washed my jeans, and I was annoyed."
2. 僕はお母さんにジーンズを**洗ってもらった**。"My mother washed my jeans, and I was grateful."
3. お母さんはジーンズを**洗ってくれた**。"My mother washed my jeans for me."

**■ まさゆめ(正夢) "prophetic dream"**

The first kanji (正) means "true," and the second kanji (夢) means "dream."

"a dream that comes true" or "a prophetic dream."

**■  **(ついている) "to be lucky"**

The verb *tsuku* has several meanings, and one of those meanings is "to be in luck."

The opposite expression is ついて　ない, meaning "to be out of luck" or "to have bad luck."

**■  **(お気に入り) "favorite"**

This expression is from the phrase *ki ni iru,* meaning "to like."

**■ っていうか**

The original phrase is "[A] *to iu yori wa mushiro* [B]," which roughly means "I would say [B] rather than [A]." This has become shortened to "[A] *to iu ka* [B]" or "[A] *tte iu ka* [B]." This expression could also mean "I mean" or "or," and we basically use it to rephrase what has just been said. However, in casual conversation among young people, they often use it as a conversation starter.

**■ じゃん "isn't it?"**

The sentence-ending expression *jan* is a contracted form of the phrase *-ja nai?* and we use it when asking for agreement from the listening party. We mainly use it in the central

and eastern areas of Japan.
