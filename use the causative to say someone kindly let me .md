## **[*Te* Form of Causative] + *Kureru***

When the helping verb *kureru* follows the -*te* form of the causative form of a verb, it means "someone kindly let me do something" or "someone kindly allowed me to do something."

**■ Sentence Structure**

- **[Person gives permission] *wa*/*ga* [*watashi* ] *ni*/*o* [*te* form of causative] *kureru***
- We usually omit the preceding *watashi ni*/*o*.

**Sample Sentences**

1. 私が大学生のとき、親は**留学させて**くれた。"When I was a college student, my parents kindly let me study abroad."
2. テレビのプロデューサーが有名人に**会わせて**くれた。"The TV producer kindly let me meet a famous person."
3. 子供のころ、母はファーストフードを**食べさせて**くれなかった。"When I was a child, my mother didn't allow me to eat fast food."

## **[*Te* Form of Causative] + *Morau***

The helping verb *morau* can also follow the -*te* form of the causative form of a verb and means "I have someone kindly let me do something" or "I have someone kindly allow me to do something." It is similar in meaning to the causative plus *kureru* construction. However, unlike with *kureru*, the subject is *watashi*, **and the particle *ni* marks the person who gives permission.

**■ Sentence Structure**

- **[*Watashi*] *wa*/*ga* [person gives permission] *ni* [*te* form of causative] *morau***
- We omit the subject *watashi wa* when it's obvious in context.

**Sample Sentences**

1. 大学生のとき、親に留学**させて**もらった。"When I was a college student, my parents kindly let me study abroad."
2. テレビのプロデューサーに有名人に**会わせて**もらった。"The TV producer kindly let me meet a famous person."

**■ How to express condolences**

Here are set phrases we use to express condolences.

- ***Kono tabi wa dōmo (go-shūshō-sama deshita).*この度は　どうも （ご愁傷様でした）。***Kono tabi* means "this occasion," and *shūshō* means "sorrow" or "grief." These words are accompanied by the honorific prefix *go*and polite suffix -*sama.* So this phrase literally means "It was your sorrow on this occasion" or "I can feel your sorrow on this occasion." In more natural English, it means "I share your sorrow" or "I'd like to offer my deepest sympathy." We often omit the latter phrase, *go-shūshō-sama deshita*, in conversation.
- ***O-kuyami o mōshiagemasu.*お悔やみを申し上げます。***Okuyami* means "condolences," and *mōshiagemasu* means "to tell" or "to state."So this phrase corresponds to "My [deepest] condolences" in English.

**■ *toka* (とか) "or something like that," "such things as," "among others"**

The conjunction *toka* is a combination of the quotation particle *to* and the question particle *ka*. We use it to give one example in an [implied] list of other things.

**■ *senjitsu* (先日) "the other day," "a few days ago"**

This word means the same as *kono mae* (この前) **or *kono aida* (この間), but it has a more formal connotation.

### **Cultural Insights**

***Kōden* (香典) "Condolence Money"**

Funeral customs vary in Japan depending on the area and religion, but attendees usually put *kōden,* or "condolence money," into an envelope called *bushūgi-bukuro*, "a special money envelope for condolence money," and bring it to the funeral.
